             ********************************************


This directory contains the following scripts:


1)  RunICPImageScanner.py

          This example script illustrates how to use the ICPImageScanner
          class in the ICP module.

          This script scans two images, one for the model and the other
          for the data, in an interactive mode.  What that means is that 
          each subimage is shown to the user before moving on to the 
          next subimage.

          The subimages extracted from the large model and data images are
          dumped in scanner dump directories whose names are keyed to the
          names of the images.

2)  ICPforOneSubimagePair.py

          This script demonstrates ICP registration of one subimage
          extracted from the large model image with the corresponding
          subimage extracted from the large data image.

          For this script to work, you have to have previously run the
          image scanner that chops the large images into subimages and
          dumps them in two scanner dump directories, one for the model 
          image and the other for the data image.  The names of the dump 
          directories are keyed to the names of the images.

3)  ICPforScannerDump_show_intermediate_results.py

          This script applies the ICP registration algorithm to ALL the
          subimage pairs extracted from the large model and data images.

          Since this script shows you ICP registration separately for each
          subimage pair, it is slower than the next script listed in this
          README.

          The final output of this script is in the form of a composite
          movie that shows ICP registration for ALL subimage pairs
          simultaneously.

4)  ICPforScannerDump_no_intermediate_results.py

          Like the previous script, this script applies the ICP algorithm
          to ALL of the subimage pairs extracted from the large model and
          data images. This script should be much faster than the previous 
          script listed above that must also display separately the ICP
          registrations for the individual pairs of subimages.

          As for the previous script, the final output of this script is in
          the form of a composite movie that shows ICP registration for ALL
          subimage pairs simultaneously.

5)  cleanup_scanner_directory.py
          
          Ordinarily, the script themselves should clean up after
          themselves.  However, should you want to kill a script midstream
          or should it abort for some reason, you can run this script to
          clean up the directory.
