This Python module is an implementation of the Iterative Closest Point
algorithm for registering a camera image with a database image.

An application scenario would be the registration of an image recorded by a
UAV-mounted camera flying over a terrain with an image extracted from GIS
(Geographical Information System) database.

See the main documentation page 

           ICP-2.1.0.html

for an overview of the module and for how to install it.

In order to become familiar with this module, you may wish to first
experiment with the six scripts in the Examples directory: See the README
in that directory.
