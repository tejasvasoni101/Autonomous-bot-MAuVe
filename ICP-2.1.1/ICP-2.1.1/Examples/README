The Examples directory contains the following six canned scripts:


1.  color_image_registration_with_edge_pixels_example1.py

          This script shows registration results with edge-based ICP on two
          color images of Sydney Opera House. (The registration itself is
          carried out on the grayscale versions of the color images.)


2.  color_image_registration_with_edge_pixels_example2.py

          This script shows registration results with edge-based ICP on
          overhead grayscale photos of a highway interchange.


3.  color_image_registration_with_edge_pixels_example3.py

          This script shows registration results on a pair of generic
          grayscale images, each with a large square block.


4.  color_image_registration_with_corner_pixels_example1.py

          This script shows registration results with corner-pixels based
          ICP on two photos of my wife's earrings.  The model photo is from
          the www.etsy.com website where these earrings are sold.  To the
          best of what I can tell, there are no copyright issues related to
          the use of this photo here.


5.   binary_image_registration_example1.py

          This is an example of registering two binary images of a
          triangular shape.


6.   binary_image_registration_example2.py

          This is another example of binary image registration that only
          involves a single straight line in the images.


It is highly recommended that you play with these example scripts before
using the module on your own images.
